# QuadcopterMicro

This project is an attempt to write the embedded code for a quadcopter. It programs an ATMEGA328p chip, to control the speed of motors using PWM, interact with the gyroscope and accelerometer via I2C, interact with a WIFI chip using UART, and 3 colour LED to indicate its status.

This project is unfinished because of hardware problems. I found that, even on full power, the motors and propellers are not able to lift the quadcopter off the ground. The project is currently on hold until I have time to fix the hardware problems.
